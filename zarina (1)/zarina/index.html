            <p>Myself Zarina Kerimalieva, live in Kyrgyzstan in the Bishkek. I am studying computer science at Ala-Too International University. I am very punctual and like to do my all works throughout the day at right time. I love drawing and reading.
            I always talk to others very happily with smiling face. I am a very simple student in my university and attend each group. I always pay attention to my study and motivate my friends as well to focus on their study.
            I have a unique family. All the members of my family are broad and open minded. They always promote me to do well in every field. They never pull me back instead motivate. I am very happy to get birth in this family. My family is cross-cultural extended family where my uncles, aunts, grandparents, cousins, etc live together. I have great time with my family because we celebrate each festival together. I help other kids in family in doing their home works daily.
